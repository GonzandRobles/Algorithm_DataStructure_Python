# Algorithm_DataStructure_Python
Summary of the book Problem solving with algorithms and data structures using Python.
I'm using jupyter notebooks to follow the examples of the book while writting descriptions of the process.

You can find the free edition of the book here: https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html

The book is divided in 8 chapters:

1. Introduction - An overview of Python as a programming language. Definition of Computer Science and why the programmer should care about data structures and algorithms.
